# Puzzle Game

**[Demo](https://daniel-projects.firebaseapp.com/games/puzzle)**

<p align="center"><img style="text-align: center;" src="/assets/puzzle.png?raw=true"></p>
8-puzzle game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.

The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order (see diagram) by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

This project was intentionally programmed to solve the n-puzzle problem with artificial inelegance algorithms.  edited from priya
